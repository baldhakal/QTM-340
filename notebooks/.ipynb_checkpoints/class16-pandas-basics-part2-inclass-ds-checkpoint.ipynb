    "We're working with this data for a number of reasons. The *Slave Voyages* project is a major data-driven contribution to the history of slavery and to the field of the digital humanities. Before the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database, as DH scholar Jessica Johnson [writes,](https://read.dukeupress.edu/social-text/article-abstract/36/4%20(137)/57/137032/Markup-BodiesBlack-Life-Studies-and-Slavery-Death?redirectedFrom=fulltext) \"historians assumed enslaved women and children played a negligible role in the slave trade.\" But evidence from the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database suggested otherwise. \"The existence of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database immediately reshaped debates about numbers of women and children exported from the continent,\" Johnson says, \"influencing work on women in the slave trade on the African coast, slavery in African societies, and women in the slave trade to the Americas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database helped shed new light on the roles of enslaved women and children, Johnson makes clear that it was not computation or data alone that shed this light: \n",
    "> [D]isplaying data alone could not and did not offer the atonement descendants of slaves sought or capture the inhumanity of this archive’s formation. Culling the lives of women and children from the data set required approaching the data with intention. It required a methodology attuned to black life and to dismantling the methods used to create the manifests in the first place, then designing and launching an interface responsive to the desire of descendants of slaves for reparation and redress.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this spirit, we want to think about how responsible data analysis requires more than just data and technical tools like pandas. It requires approaching data with intention and developing methodologies geared toward justice. This is especially necessary when dealing with data that records and perpetrates violence like the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database."
