    "\n",
    "To perform practical approaches to data science with text, we need...**text**. Some text is prepared for computational analysis and publicly available in digital libraries. We can easily get novels in the public domain as .txt files, for example, from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Or we can work with text from HathiTrust's vast collections through the [HathiTrust Research Center](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to work with text from popular culture and the internet--and we do!--we often need to scrape the web. To understand the necessity and significance of web scraping, let's walk through the likely data collection process behind [“Film Dialogue from 2,000 screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age”](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/) or any project similar to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest sources for *The Pudding*'s screenplay data was the [Cornell Movie Dialogues Corpus](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). This is a corpus created by Cornell CIS professors Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee for their paper [\"Chameleons in imagined conversations\"](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/papers/chameleons.pdf). These researchers helpfully shared a dataset of every URL that they used to find and access the screenplays in their own project."

    "\n",
    "In more official terms, it's called a *list comprehension*, and it helps with a very common task in both data analysis and computer programming: when you want to apply an operation to every item in a list (e.g., scaling the numbers in a list by a fixed factor), or create a copy of a list with only those items that match a particular criterion (e.g., eliminating values that fall below a certain threshold). \n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension has a few parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a source list, or the list whose values will be transformed or filtered;\n",
    "* a predicate expression, to be evaluated for every item in the list;\n",
    "* (optionally) a membership expression that determines whether or not an item in the source list will be included in the result of evaluating the list comprehension, based on whether the expression evaluates to True or False; and\n",
    "* a temporary variable name by which each value from the source list will be known in the predicate expression and membership expression.\n",
    "These parts are arranged like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `[` *predicate expression* `for` *temporary variable name* `in` *source list* `if` *membership expression* `]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The words for, in, and if are a part of the syntax of the expression. They don't mean anything in particular (and in fact, they do completely different things in other parts of the Python language). You just have to spell them right and put them in the right place in order for the list comprehension to work.\n",
