    "## What is BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT is short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. You don't need to understand every part of that title. Google defines it as \"a neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training.\" Google continues:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This technology enables anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system. This breakthrough was the result of Google research on transformers: models that process words in relation to all the other words in a sentence, rather than one-by-one in order. BERT models can therefore consider the full context of a word by looking at the words that come before and after it—particularly useful for understanding the intent behind search queries.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about how sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word2vec work: they all track text by taking words \"one-by-one in order\". Can you see why BERT is an exciting advance?"

    "## Why BERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Progress has been rapidly accelerating in machine learning models that process language. This progress has left the research lab and started powering some of the leading digital products. A great example of this is [the announcement in October 2019 of how the BERT model is now a major force behind Google Search](https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/). Google believes this progress in NLP represents “the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search”."
