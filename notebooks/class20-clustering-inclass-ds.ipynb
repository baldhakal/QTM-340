    "Last week, we learned about classification, which assumes we have a test set of data that we have already categorized: in our case, we categorized by gender. When we run models with labeled data, we call it _supervised learning_.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens when we don't have labeled data? Is it possible to learn anything? \n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is known as *unsupervised learning*, and we will see that it is very possible to learn about the underlying structure of unlabeled observations. "

    "## An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a scenario: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you scrape thousands of news articles. And suppose you want to organize, or cluster, those documents by their prevalence of language about hurricanes vs elections. You could choose a group of words relate to hurricanes and make the x-axis the frequency with which those words appear in the documents. You could do the same for words related to elections on the y-axis. We might imagine the articles clustering into four groups: one for documents that are largely about a hurricane, another for documents largely about a election, a third for documents about neither, and a fourth for documents, however unlikely, about both.\n",
    "\n",
    "These clusters represent an underlying structure of the data. But it's still supervised, because we've labeled words as belonging to categories and used them to organize documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning applies the same basic idea, but in a high-dimensional space with one dimension for every word. As such, the space can’t be visualized. But the goal is the same as in two-dimensions: identify an underlying structure of the observed data, such that documents cluster, and each cluster is internally coherent. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering algorithms** are capable of finding such structure automatically."

    "## Enter k-means clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering algorithms assign each data point—for us, each document—to a discrete cluster. One of the best known clustering algorithms is k-means, an iterative algorithm that maintains a cluster assignment for each instance, and a central (\"mean\") location for each cluster. K-means iterates between updates to the assignments and the centers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. each instance is placed in the cluster with the closest center;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. each center is recomputed as the average over points in the cluster."

    "**NOTE:** An important property of k-means is that the converged solution depends on the initialization, and a better clustering can sometimes be found simply by re-running the algorithm from a different random starting point."

Since increasing the number of clusters will always reduce the distance to data points, increasing k will always decrease this metric, to the extreme of reaching zero when k is the same as the number of data points. Thus, this metric cannot be used as the sole target. Instead, mean distance to the centroid as a functionkof k is plotted and the \"elbow point,\" where the rate of decrease sharply shifts, can be used to roughly determine K.\n",
